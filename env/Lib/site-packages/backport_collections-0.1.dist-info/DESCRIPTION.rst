backport_collections is a backport of Python 2.7's ``collections`` module for Python 2.6.

What is backported?
-------------------

``Counter``, ``deque``, ``OrderedDict`` and ``namedtuple`` are backported.
The rest of the members of the ``collections`` module are still exposed. Note
though that some ``ABC`` classes are slighlty different (see known issues below).

Usage
-----

To use it just import the desired classes from the module ``backport_collections``.
Example::

    from backport_collections import Counter
    from backport_collections import deque
    from backport_collections import OrderedDict
    from backport_collections import namedtuple

Known Issues
------------

* In Python 2.6 Issue 9137 is not fixed as it complains if it gets a keyword
  argument named ``self``. The error is ``TypeError: update() got multiple values for keyword argument 'self'``.
  Additionally the keyword argument cannot be called ``other`` either as it will think it is the full dict. No error is raised in this case.

* In Python 2.6 Issue 8743 is not fully fixed: Set interoperability with real sets
